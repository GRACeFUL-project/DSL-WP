2016-01-25: GRACeFUL 12 month meeting in Barcelona

# WP4: DSL workpackage overview

## Personnel

* Site leader: Patrik Jansson, working 20% for GRACeFUL
* PhD student: Irene Lobo Valbuena (from 2015-08-01), working 80% for GRACeFUL
* Until 2015-09 (8 months) Cezar Ionescu was also working on the project. He now has a position in Oxford (but remains co-supervisor of Irene).

## Events and dissemination

* [D4.1: Formal description of concept map elements needed for CRUD case study (m6)](../deliverables/d4.1/)
    * The work towards the first WP4 deliverable helped clarifying the underlying theoretical basis and the terminology.
* [ACCFun: Algorithmic Calculi for Constraint Functional Programming](ACCFun.md)
    * A 5-day "by invitation only"-workshop in the GRACeFUL project.
    * 4 participants from GRACeFUL: Patrik, Cezar, Irene, Tom Schrijvers
    * 28 participants in total
    * "The [GRACeFUL project](https://www.graceful-project.eu/) develops connections between functional and constraint programming, requiring a unified expression of programs, constraints, traditional numerical mathematical models and qualitative models. The members of the IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi have developed a large body of expertise in the design of notations for calculating programs from specifications, covering all programming paradigms. Such a notation could provide the glue between functional and constraint programming, required in GRACeFUL. On the other hand, the various programs developed in GRACeFUL can provide a test-bed for the notation and suggest extensions or improvements to it. The aim of this workshop is to create a close connection between GRACeFUL and IFIP2.1. The workshop is co-located with the [73rd IFIP WG 2.1 meeting organised in GÃ¶teborg](http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/IFIP21/Goteborg)."
