# GRACeFUL project DSL workpackage

This repository contains open source material related to the
workpackage "Domain-Specific Languages for System Dynamics Models" in
the EU-project [GRACeFUL](https://www.graceful-project.eu/).

## From the Grant Agreement
(reformatted)

[The task is] To build a DSL for translating the concept maps developed and
manipulated during GMB sessions to system dynamics models adequate for
the CFP layer.

One of the most successful mechanisms for managing complexity is
linguistic abstraction: the creation of DSLs, especially designed for
expressing problems and their solutions in a given domain.

The overall purpose of WP4 is
to use a DSL for policy concept maps, logic and relations
* to bridge between
    * the complexity of the CRUD case study from WP2 (visualised in WP3)
* and
    * the underlying science and technology of WP4.

In the longer term this will lead to a DSL aimed at building scalable
RATs for collective policy making in Global Systems.

During the project we will work with embedded DSLs to improve
scalability, verifiability and correctness of the models.

This WP builds on several years of research on DSLs for modelling
global systems (FP7 CA GSDP).

### Description of work
* T4.1 identify key underlying concepts needed for the CRUD case study
* T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions
* T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL
* T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer
* T4.5 build a testing and verification framework for RATs
