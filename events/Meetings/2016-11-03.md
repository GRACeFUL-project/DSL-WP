## Testing and verification

Björn: (from pre-meeting 2016-11-01 with Björn+Oskar+Maximilian):

  "We have set a task for ourselves to investigate how to express
  constraints on actions (prop. logic, minisat, LTL, quickcheck, ...)
  and how to mine the results for something useful to report back to
  the user."
