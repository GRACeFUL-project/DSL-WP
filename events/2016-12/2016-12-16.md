2016-12-16: Björn Norgren: Property Based Testing

* Properties as specifications
* Properties as checked documentations

## demo: develop merge sort with quickCheck properties

Note:
* properties help driving the implementation forward
* shrinking of test cases gives good hints about the nature of the bugs
* sometimes the random generators need to be tweaked


## Next step

Special support for property based testing of GenericLibrary components.

# Parallell sessions before lunch

* semantics: Patrik + Solrun
    * working through the ../semantics/CLDsemantics/ document
* costs and synergies: Nicolas + Tom + Ekaterina
    * whiteboard photo
* output parsing: Björn + Maximilian
    * Oskar mentioned that new versions of minizinc can output in JSON format (for better information interchange)
    * only works with versions of minizinc which is newer than the binary distributions
* type level DSL for calculations with units (meter, seconds, etc.)
    * Maximilian
* specification of qualitative modelling addition with more signs {--,-,0,+,++}
    * KlaraMar + Ekaterina
