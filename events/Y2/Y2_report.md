# Chalmers GRACeFUL Year 2 report (2016-02 / 2017-02)

By Patrik Jansson, 2017-02-19.

## Technical achievements w.r.t. WP objectives and tasks,

We have worked mainly on T4.2 and T4.3 of the DSL work package:

* T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions
* T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL

This resulted in one deliverable which was handed in on time:

* [D4.2](../../deliverables/d4.2/): A Domain Specific Language (DSL) for GRACeFUL Concept Maps

and associated
[open source code on GitHub](https://github.com/GRACeFUL-project/GRACe) including
examples and install instructions (through a Docker image).

KULeuven has also contributed by initial work on T4.4

* T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer

which will be the main focus after the Y2 review in March.

## Research publications (progress beyond state-of-the-art)

Three GRACeFUL-relevant papers in 2016, in different stages of acceptance:
* Paper A was accepted and published (+presented) at TyDe'16
* Paper B: was accepted to LMCS in Oct. 2016 and is [available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07145) (but had still not appeared in the journal by 2017-01)
* Paper C: is under review for JFP (submitted 2016-11)

## Organization and personnel
