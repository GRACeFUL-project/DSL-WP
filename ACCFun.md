## [ACCFun: Algorithmic Calculi for Constraint Functional Programming](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/cse/pmwiki.php/ST/ACCFun)
(A "by invitation only"-workshop in the GRACeFUL project.)

The [GRACeFUL project](https://www.graceful-project.eu/) develops connections between functional and constraint programming, requiring a unified expression of programs, constraints, traditional numerical mathematical models and qualitative models. The members of the IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi have developed a large body of expertise in the design of notations for calculating programs from specifications, covering all programming paradigms. Such a notation could provide the glue between functional and constraint programming, required in GRACeFUL. On the other hand, the various programs developed in GRACeFUL can provide a test-bed for the notation and suggest extensions or improvements to it. The aim of this workshop is to create a close connection between GRACeFUL and IFIP2.1. The workshop is co-located with the [73rd IFIP WG 2.1 meeting organised in Göteborg](http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/IFIP21/Goteborg).
