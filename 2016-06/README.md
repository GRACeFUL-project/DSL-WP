# 2016-06-20/22: GRACeFUL DSL work sprint at Chalmers (Gothenburg, Sweden)

2016-03-31: Doodle invitation from Irene: We will be having a WP4 work
sprint working on the concept map DSL (for further translation to
models - at the CSP level - later on) in June. [...] The work sprint
is meant to involve WP4 and WP2 mainly, but it might be of interest if
you’ve input for the DSL.  Do note that the aim is to advance in the
actual design and implementation work directly.

2016-04-07: Doodle closed by Irene: Given the poll results, the work
sprint will take place 2016-06-20 to 2016-06-22 (preliminarily:
starting at/after lunch time Monday, ending also at lunch time on
Wednesday). [...]

Prel. list of participants (from the doodle):

* Tom Creemers
* Patrik Jansson
* Linda Nijland
* Sadie
* Klara Mar.
* Irene Lobo Valbuena

2016-04-13: Created this page to gather information about the work
sprint.
