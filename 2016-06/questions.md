# Questions for participants

## Questions related to [Deliverable D2.3](https://seafile.idmt.de/seafhttp/files/23b6c4b0-7045-40da-8447-6b7029973e90/D2.3.pdf)

* The document mentions uncertainty on several occasions. What are some examples of uncertainties that you wish were possible
  to model in the DSL? (T4.2)

* On page 16, under the "Data manipulation" column, it says:
  "Combining uncertainty ... with alternatives"
  Please elaborate on what the semantics of this combination are (T4.2, T4.3, T4.5)

## Questions related to [Deliverable D2.2](https://seafile.idmt.de/seafhttp/files/57576c02-12ee-4484-b167-be22cabf7f46/D2.2.pdf)

* Page 8, bullet point 5, mentions setting up simulations to
  analyze alternatives. How do these simulations work? (T4.3, T4.5)

## Questions on Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs)

* What is an example of a minimal (no more than 4 nodes) CLD,
  and what are it's semantics (what would be the input parameters
  to a computer simulation modeling this CLD, how does the computer simulation
  work)? (T4.3, T4.5)

* How important is time in modeling the behaviour of CLDs? (T4.3, T4.5)

* Are actions subject to some temporal semantic. That is, should the system
  be able to model actions taken at varying times? (T4.3, T4.5)

## General questions on DSL-design

* Please rank the following by how important you think it is for the
  DSL to be able to model them: (T4.2)
    * Causal Loop Diagrams
    * Geographic zones 
    * Topological networks
    * Runoff flow networks
    * Action application options
