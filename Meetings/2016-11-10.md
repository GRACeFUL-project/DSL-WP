2016-11-10: Planning for the Deltares work sprint

Wanted: minimal examples
* CLD with 3-4 nodes, one geographical contraint

Minimal viable product, minimal demo requirements.

How do geographical contraints and CLD go together?

----

Maximilian + Solrun have done some work on the semantics side.

Bj√∂rn has done some work on graph editing.
