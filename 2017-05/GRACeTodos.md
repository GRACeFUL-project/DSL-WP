# GRACe TODOs from the Delft worksprintx 2017-05-03/04/05

* Implement the `linkAppropriate` flag for components, "this component can be used as a link"

* Implement a `cardinality` variable for ports, how many ports can be connected
  to this port?
  * Implement this functionality in GRACe

* Tutorial for writing GRACe components

* Newtypes

* Subtyping, an `Inflow` is a `Flow` etc.

* Arbitrary key-value tagging of things in a `Library`
