# GRACe TODOs from the Delft worksprintx 2017-05-03/04/05

1. Clean up module structure

2. Tutorial for writing GRACe components

3. Arbitrary key-value tagging of things in a `Library`

4. Implement the `linkAppropriate` flag for components, "this component can be used as a link"

5. Implement a `cardinality` variable for ports, how many ports can be connected
   to this port?
    * Implement this functionality in GRACe

6. Newtypes

7. Subtyping, an `Inflow` is a `Flow` etc.
