  abstract =     {We present the starting elements of a mathematical
                  theory of policy advice and avoidability. More
                  specifically, we formalize a cluster of notions
                  related to policy advice, such as policy, viability,
                  reachability, and propose a novel approach for
                  assisting decision making, based on the concept of
                  avoidability. We formalize avoidability as a
                  relation between current and future states,
                  investigate under which conditions this relation is
                  decidable and propose a generic procedure for
                  assessing avoidability. The formalization is
                  constructive and makes extensive use of the
                  correspondence between dependent types and logical
                  propositions, decidable judgments are obtained
                  through computations. Thus, we aim for a
                  computational theory, and emphasize the role that
                  computer science can play in global system science.}
