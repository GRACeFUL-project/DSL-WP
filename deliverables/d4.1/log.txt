2015-07-30: Patrik: check if the datatype context can be removed:

  ghc-7.10 says:
     -XDatatypeContexts is deprecated: It was widely considered a misfeature, and has been removed from the Haskell language.

  Uses:

data (Ord value) => Factor value  =  MkFactor Name (Maybe value)
data (Ord value) => Criterion value  =
      MkCriterion Name (Maybe value) (Predicate value)
