* Abstract

This third deliverable (D4.3) of work package 4 presents the
translation of GRACeFUL concept maps (expressed as GRACe programs) to
the Constraint Functional Programming (CFP) layer. This report builds
on the description of GRACe in “D4.2: A Domain Specific Language (DSL)
for GRACeFUL Concept Maps” (delivered in project month 24) and the
third release of the CFP layer “haskelzinc”. (The first release was
described in “D5.1: Domain-Specific Language for the Constraint
Functional Programming Platform” and the latest version is available
from the Haskell package repository Hackage.)  The work leading up to
this deliverable is within Task 4.3 “implement a middleware for
connecting the DSL to the CFP layer” and the full source code of the
implementation is available on github.
