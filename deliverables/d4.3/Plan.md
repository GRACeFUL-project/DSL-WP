Plan for Deliverable 4.3
==============================
Contents
---------
**Translation of GRACeFUL concept maps (of system dynamics models) to the CFP layer**

(Corresponding to Task T4.4: implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer.)

* What exactly does this mean?
    * A GRACeFUL concept map is described in D4.2 (basically a GRACe program)
    * The CFP layer is (some version) of the HaskelZinc backend
* Do we want to make additions/improvements to GRACe before writing this deliverable? If so, what?
    * It will need to evolve but not major additions are planned.

Outline:
* Introduction explaining the title (see above)
* Examples of GRACe programs and the way they are translated
* Software architecture
* Properties and tests
* Appendix: Installation and usage
