\input{architecture}
% Front-end URL: http://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/graceful-rat/static/index.html
% TODO (after 2017-11-17 when the front end functionality should be more stable): take screen shot(s) showing some model


\subsection{Scope and limitations}

This deliverable (D4.4) covers the software technology side of testing
and verification of RATs.
%
The CRUD RAT evaluation based on stakeholder sessions is reported
elsewhere [D2.6 Evaluation Report CRUD RATs: m36] as is the
interactivity and usability of the visual front-end [T3.4, D3.3 VA EDA
  Tool Prototype (RAT components): m34].

\subsection{Rapid Assessment Tools}

Rapid assessment tools are used in large organisations like the World
Bank and the United Nations to assess risks and needs and to make
plans for improvement.

In GRACeFUL the main focus is on Climate Resiliant Urban Design, but
the software developed in the project could be used for almost any
Global Systems Science problem.
