\todo{Patrik+Solrun: Introduce RATs and describe our prototype RAT: screen shot, software architecture}

% Front-end URL: http://vocol.iais.fraunhofer.de/graceful-rat/static/index.html
% TODO (after 2017-11-17 when the front end functionality should be more stable): take screen shot(s) showing some model

Scope and limitations: this deliverable (D4.4) covers the software
technology side of testing and verification of RATs.
%
The CRUD RAT evaluation based on stakeholder sessions is reported
elsewhere [D2.6 Evaluation Report CRUD RATs: m36] as is the
interactivity and usability of the visual front-end [T3.4, D3.3 VA EDA
  Tool Prototype (RAT components): m34].
