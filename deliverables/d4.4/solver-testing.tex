% Some notes on things we've found out so far
Sometimes the two backends return different solutions, this seems to be due to
the output minizinc code having a different ordering of variable declaration.
(see https://github.com/GRACeFUL-project/GRACe/tree/master/examples/multi)

When optimizing minizinc/the underlying solver only returns the first optimal solution found, if you ask for more solutions you get intermediate solutions found before the first optimal one.
The way to get all optimal solutions is to get the first optimal one and add it as a constraint for the variable being optimized, then running with solve satisfy and outputting all solutions.
