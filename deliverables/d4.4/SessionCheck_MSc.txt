Abstract

This report presents a new tool called SessionCheck. This tool helps programmers write distributed applications that work correctly. SessionCheck is designed to help rid programmers of the tedium of maintaining more than one specification and test suite for multiple application components.  SessionCheck does this by borrowing ideas from session types and domain specific languages in order to provide a simple yet expressive and compositional specification language for communication protocols. Specifications written in the SessionCheck specification language can be used to test both client and server implementations of the same protocol in a completely language-agnostic manner.
