Deliverable 4.4 todos 2018-01-16
========================================
Ongoing
-----------------
* Sólrún: Write more about GCMP, fix code so we can use it, add some more properties to test using it.

TODO
-----
* Write something in Solver Testing section (could just be about how we use unit tests to test our whole software stack).
* Write something about unit tests / our test suite. 
* Related work - currently we have a related work section about SessionCheck, if we're going to have a related work section it should contain more stuff. 
{-
From Y2 review: ``We suggest that deliverables consisting of software
products also contain a written document that includes motivations,
use cases, explanations, user’s manuals, and informal semantics (if
possible).''

Note that D4.4 and D2.5 are both deliverables of type

  "DEM: Demonstrator, Pilot, Plans",

which is not described in detail in the H2020 documentation.
