Deliverable 4.4 todos 2017-12-22
========================================
Start off with:
-----------------
* Alex: Finish writing
  * intro about property-based testing and
  * section about type systems as a verification technique.
* Sólrún: Look into actually using SessionCheck to test our system, what needs to be implemented?
* Max:
  * Help Sólrún figure out how to use SessionCheck.

{-
From Y2 review: ``We suggest that deliverables consisting of software
products also contain a written document that includes motivations,
use cases, explanations, user’s manuals, and informal semantics (if
possible).''

Note that D4.4 and D2.5 are both deliverables of type

  "DEM: Demonstrator, Pilot, Plans",

which is not described in detail in the H2020 documentation.

Later
------
* Write about GCMP, come up with more properties to test there?
* Write something in Solver Testing section
