{-
From Y2 review: ``We suggest that deliverables consisting of software
products also contain a written document that includes motivations,
use cases, explanations, user’s manuals, and informal semantics (if
possible).''

Note that D4.4 and D2.5 are both deliverables of type

  "DEM: Demonstrator, Pilot, Plans",

which is not described in detail in the H2020 documentation.
