\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

We provide some background information about several aspects we use in
later sections, such that they become more accessible.
%
Whenever possible we give links for further reading as well.

\paragraph{\acl{DSL}} \citet{fowler} defines a \ac{DSL} as follows:
%
\emph{a computer programming language of limited expressiveness
  focussed on a particular domain}.
%
A \ac{DSL} is targetted at a specific class of programming tasks.
%
By restricting scope to a particular domain, one can tailor the
language specifically for that domain.
%
There are two main approaches to implementing \acp{DSL}:
\begin{description}
\item[standalone] A language with their own specialised syntax and
  parser to translate programs written in the \ac{DSL} into the host
  language.
%
  An advantage is that the syntax can be tailor made for the target
  audience, and does not have to resemble the host language.
%
  However, creating such a \ac{DSL} is labour intensive and it cannot
  easily reuse features, such as variables and conditionals, from the
  host language.
\item[embedded] An embedded language tries to offer a convenient
  syntax and abstraction mechanisms, but is offered as a library
  written in the host language.
%
  This means that all the existing facilities, such as abstractions
  standard libraries, are directly available.
%
  A disadvantage of an embedded \ac{DSL} is that the users may be
  unfamiliar with the host language.
\end{description}
\citet{Gibbons2015} gives a good overview of implementing \acp{DSL}
using functional programming.

% \paragraph{Semi-qualitative modelling} \todo{don't know if we should explain
% this here}

\paragraph{Constraint programming} Similar to functional and logic
programming, constraint programming is a declarative programming
paradigm, which means that the order of processing is not fixed.
%
A constraint program is formulated in terms of a number of
constraints.
%
Such constraints are different from the common primitives of
imperative programming languages in that they do not specify a step or
sequence of steps to execute, but rather the properties of a solution
to be found.
%
The program that identifies the solutions satisfying these constraints
is called a onstraint solver.
%
In general there might be none, one, or many solutions to a particular
contraint problem.

The constraint programming approach is to search for a state in which
a large number of constraints are satisfied at the same time.
%
A problem is typically expressed as a state containing a number of
unknown variables.
%
The constraint solver searches for values for all the variables.

\paragraph{\acfp{GCM}}

%Factors, Criteria, Actions

%Outcomes: help the stakeholders

%\begin{itemize}
%\item find alternative policies that can satisfy the goals,
%\item identify inconsistencies in the problem definition,
%\item  present visualisations of possible future trajectories.
%\end{itemize}

In a \acl{GMB} session stakeholders perform a policy analysis that
results in the form of a \acl{GCM}.
%
This concept map contains important elements of a policy problem
definition: goals, criteria for assessing the achievement of those
goals, a description of the system involving factors and criteria, and
the competing alternatives.

The term \emph{factors} refers to characteristics of a system that can
take a value, either quantitative or qualitative, that can change over
time (source: the \emph{GRACeFUL Glossary of Terms}).
%
Similarly, \emph{external factors} correspond to \emph{inputs} to the
system.
%
As such, factors are assumed to be associated with measurable
values.
%
As in systems theory, a distinction is made between inputs that are
beyond the control of the system, and which are potentially uncertain
(or even unknown), and \emph{actions} or combinations of actions,
which represent the system theoretical \emph{controls}.

The interaction between the factors, and between the factors and the
criteria, represents a first description of the system.
%
This description is in the form of a stock-and-flow diagram (which is
a generalisation of \aclp{CLD}~\cite{burns}).
%
A causal loop diagram is a form of \emph{directed, simple, labelled
  graph}, i.e.:

TODO: AG: I have come this far.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\item
  a link between two nodes has a well-defined source and a target (it is
  \emph{directed}); intuitively, the link represents a causal relation
  between the source (cause) and the target (effect);
\item
  there can be at most one connection from one node to another (the
  graph is \emph{simple}): either a causal relation exists, or it does
  not. Note, however, that since the graph is directed, there may be an
  inverse connection from the ``effect'' to the ``cause'', as in
  feedback loops;
\item
  the connections are either \emph{positive} (an increase in the value
  of the source causes an increase in the value of the target), or
  \emph{negative} (an increase causes a decrease), hence the graph is
  \emph{labelled}.
\end{enumerate}

It can be seen from the last point that nodes \emph{must} represent
values that can be partially ordered. This rules out nodes that
represent, say, stakeholders.

The GRACeFUL system can assist in building the causal loop diagram, for
example by suggesting connections, or by pointing out inconsistencies.

At this stage, if we can attribute qualitative values to the various
nodes, the causal loop diagram describes a system that can make the
object of a qualitative simulation. The criteria play the roles of
constraints: the qualitative trajectories that lead outside the criteria
can be pruned by the constraint programming system.

The causal loop diagram is enhanced to a GRACeFUL concept map by the
addition of extra nodes and non-causal links. The extra nodes represent
actions, goals, alternatives, and stakeholders.

Like all previous elements, the actions are also obtained from the
stakeholders. As explained in the previous section, actions are the
components of alternatives, among which will be found the policy
solutions we are seeking. Alternatives are, according to the GRACeFUL
Glossary of Terms, ``action or combination of actions that influence the
values of criteria''. They correspond to Walker's ``alternative
policies'', where a \emph{policy} is defined ``loosely'' as ``a set of
actions taken to solve a problem''. As in the case of goal definition,
the GRACeFUL system can suggest such ``atomic actions'' that are useful
to the goals in the context of the problem at hand.

The role of actions in the GRACeFUL concept maps is to give initial
values to the factors and criteria they influence. They do not link via
causal loops to these factors, since actions are not of the requisite
type (they do not represent values that can increase or decrease).
However, they will usually have non-causal links, representing
constraining relationships to the factors.

In the other cases of extra nodes (goals, alternatives, and
stakeholders), the links represent primarily ``belongs to''
relationships: there are links from stakeholders to goals, indicating
which stakeholders have declared which goals; there are links from goals
to the criteria by which they are assessed; finally, there are links
between alternatives and the factors and criteria that they (i.e., their
constituent atomic actions) influence.
