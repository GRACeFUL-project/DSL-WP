\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The main task of Work Package 4 is to build a DSL for translating the
causal loop diagrams
\todo{shouldn't this say GCMs rather than CLDs?}
developed and manipulated during Group Model
Building (GMB) sessions to system dynamics models adequate for the
Constraint Functional Programming (CFP) layer.

The overall purpose of WP4 is to use a DSL for GRACeFUL concept maps,
logic and relations to bridge between the complexity of the CRUD case
study from WP2 and the underlying science and technology of WP5.  In
the longer term this will lead to a DSL aimed at building scalable
RATs for collective policy making in Global Systems.  During the
project we work with embedded DSLs to improve scalability,
verifiability and correctness of the models.

Deliverable D4.1 reported on task T4.1 and this document mainly
reports on the work in tasks T4.2 and T4.3 but also includes some
initial results from T4.4 and T4.5.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item T4.1 identify key underlying concepts needed for the CRUD case study
%\item T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions
%\item T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL
%\item T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer
%\item T4.5 build a testing and verification framework for RATs
%\end{itemize}
