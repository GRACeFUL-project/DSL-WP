## Abstract

This second deliverable of WP4 includes a short overview of a Domain
Specific Language (DSL) for description of GRACeFUL concept maps, and
a formal semantics in terms of types and functions. This is a
continuation of the initial work described in "D4.1 Formal Concept
Maps Elements Descriptions" delivered in project month 6. The actual
source code implementing the DSL is freely available in the project
repository on GitHub: https://github.com/GRACeFUL-project/.


## Introduction

The main task of Work Package 4 is to build a DSL for translating the
causal loop diagrams developed and manipulated during Group Model
Building (GMB) sessions to system dynamics models adequate for the
Constraint Functional Programming (CFP) layer.

The overall purpose of WP4 is to use a DSL for GRACeFUL concept maps,
logic and relations to bridge between the complexity of the CRUD case
study from WP2 and the underlying science and technology of WP5.  In
the longer term this will lead to a DSL aimed at building scalable
RATs for collective policy making in Global Systems.  During the
project we work with embedded DSLs to improve scalability,
verifiability and correctness of the models.

Deliverable D4.1 reported on task T4.1 and this document mainly
reports on the work in tasks T4.2 and T4.3 but also includes some
initial results from T4.4 and T4.5.

* T4.1 identify key underlying concepts needed for the CRUD case study
* T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions
* T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL
* T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer
* T4.5 build a testing and verification framework for RATs

## An overview of GraphDSL

TODO: Update with newer examples + explanation text

### Example: Coastal Management

![Coastal Management Example (Van Kouwen, 2007, p.68, Fig. 4.5)](../../2016-09/coastalManagement.pdf)

### Example: Coastal Management: DSL textual input

```Haskell
coastalManagement = do
  -- nodes
  seaLevelRise    <- mkNode "sea level rise"
  riskOfFlooding  <- mkNode "risk of flooding"
  flooding        <- mkNode "flooding"
  investments     <- mkNode "investments"
  measuresToPreventFlooding <- mkNode "measures to prevent flooding"
  ecologyInTheCoastalZone   <- mkNode "ecology in the coastal zone"
  -- edges
  link seaLevelRise >+> riskOfFlooding >+> flooding
                    >+> measuresToPreventFlooding
  link measuresToPreventFlooding >-> ecologyInTheCoastalZone
  link measuresToPreventFlooding >-> riskOfFlooding
  link investments >+> measuresToPreventFlooding
```

## Software infrastructure (around the DSL)

TODO: Replace by a more current description of the software status

* (VIS layer)
* GraphDSL (describe the graph) + ConstraintDSL (still ongoing work)
* QPNModeler: encodes the Qualitative Probabilistic Network semantics
* haskelzinc: Haskell interface to (and from) MiniZinc
* (MiniZinc)

## Semantics

TODO[Solrun]: write a few pages about semantics
