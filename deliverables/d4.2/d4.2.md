## Abstract

This second deliverable of WP4 includes a short overview of a Domain
Specific Language (DSL) for description of GRACeFUL concept maps, and
a formal semantics in terms of types and functions. This is a
continuation of the initial work described in "D4.1 Formal Concept
Maps Elements Descriptions" delivered in project month 6. The actual
source code implementing the DSL is freely available in the project
repository on GitHub: https://github.com/GRACeFUL-project/.


## Introduction

The main task of Work Package 4 is to build a DSL for translating the
causal loop diagrams developed and manipulated during Group Model
Building (GMB) sessions to system dynamics models adequate for the
Constraint Functional Programming (CFP) layer.

The overall purpose of WP4 is to use a DSL for GRACeFUL concept maps,
logic and relations to bridge between the complexity of the CRUD case
study from WP2 and the underlying science and technology of WP5.  In
the longer term this will lead to a DSL aimed at building scalable
RATs for collective policy making in Global Systems.  During the
project we work with embedded DSLs to improve scalability,
verifiability and correctness of the models.

Deliverable D4.1 reported on task T4.1 and this document mainly
reports on the work in tasks T4.2 and T4.3 but also includes some
initial results from T4.4 and T4.5.

* T4.1 identify key underlying concepts needed for the CRUD case study
* T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions
* T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL
* T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer
* T4.5 build a testing and verification framework for RATs

## An overview of GenericLibrary (or whatever the name)

TODO[MaAl+OsAb]: Update with newer examples + explanation text

GenericLibrary, henceforth abbreviated to GL, is a DSL for descriptions
of GRACeFUL concept map components in Haskell. The DSL is divided in to
two parts. The first part, `GCM`, allows the user to describe the interactions
of GRACeFUL concept map components and has facilities for constructing new components from
existing ones. The second part, `CP`, features primitives for constructing
constraint programs which describe the behaviour of an individual components. 

TODO: This section needs clarification
The architecture is demonstrated in the example below. A `GCM` component exposing
a single port is defined, it contains a small `CP` program (in the `component` block)
which describes the local behaviour of the component and features a local variable
which is unreachable from the outer, structural, description.

```Haskell
gcmComponent :: GCM (Port Float)
gcmComponent = do
  externalPort <- createPort
  component $ do
   variable <- createLVar 
   assert (externalPort === variable + 1)
  return externalPort
```

### Example: Runoff flow

TODO: Maybe we should use the "rain and pump" example from the work sprint instead?
![Coastal Management Example (Van Kouwen, 2007, p.68, Fig. 4.5)](../../2016-09/coastalManagement.pdf)

### Example: Runoff flow: DSL textual input

```Haskell
-- Small example
example :: GCM ()
example = do

  -- Instantiate components
  r <- rain 20
  pmp <- pump 2
  (inf, out, ovf, cap) <- storage 4
  (floodFlow, isFlooded) <- floodingOfSquare

  -- Instantiate actions
  pumpAction <- increasePumpCapacityAction (capacity pmp)

  -- Link ports
  link inf r
  link (inflow pmp) out
  link ovf floodFlow

  -- Make sure there is no flooding
  set isFlooded False
```

## Software infrastructure (around the DSL)

TODO: Replace by a more current description of the software status

TODO: Should we even describe the two different software stacks?

* (VIS layer)
* GenericLibrary
* (MiniZinc)

* (VIS layer)
* GraphDSL (describe the graph) + ConstraintDSL (still ongoing work)
* QPNModeler: encodes the Qualitative Probabilistic Network semantics
* haskelzinc: Haskell interface to (and from) MiniZinc
* (MiniZinc)

### Install script and requirements

TODO[OsAb]: insert from the other repo.

## Semantics

TODO[Solrun]: write a few pages about semantics
