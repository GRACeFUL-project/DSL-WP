## Personnel at Chalmers

* Site leader: Patrik Jansson, working 20% for GRACeFUL
* Until 2015-09 (8 months) Cezar Ionescu was a PostDoc on the project. Now in Oxford (but remains co-supervisor of Irene).
* PhD student: Irene Lobo Valbuena (started 2015-08-01, 80%)

## Tasks

Main task: Build a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for translating the
concept maps developed and manipulated during Group Model Building
(GMB) sessions to system dynamics models adequate for the constraint
funcional programming (CFP) layer.

The overall purpose of WP4 is to use a DSL for policy concept maps,
logic and relations

* to bridge between
    * the complexity of the CRUD case study from WP2 (visualised in WP3)
* and
    * the underlying science and technology of WP5.

In the longer term this will lead to a DSL aimed at building scalable
Rapid Assessment Tools (RATs) for collective policy making in Global
Systems.

During the project we will work with embedded DSLs to improve
scalability, verifiability and correctness of the models.

## What have we worked on?

* Description of work
    * Done: **T4.1 identify key underlying concepts needed for the CRUD case study**
    * Started: **T4.2 develop a DSL to describe the concept maps developed during GMB sessions**
    * Started: **T4.3 provide a formal semantics for the elements of the DSL**
    * T4.4 implement a middleware for connecting the DSL to the CFP layer
    * T4.5 build a testing and verification framework for RATs

* [Deliverables](../deliverables/)
    * [D4.1](../deliverables/d4.1/) **Done**: Formal description of concept map elements needed for CRUD case study (m6)
    * [D4.2](../deliverables/d4.2/) **DSL for description of concept maps, with formal semantics (m24)**
    * [D4.3](../deliverables/d4.3/) Translation of concept map descriptions to system dynamics models for the CFP layer (m30)
    * [D4.4](../deliverables/d4.4/) Testing and verification framework for RATs with applications to the CRUD case study (m36)

## Relation to the state of the art

* Main focus: applying the state-of-the-art in Domain Specific Languages to the domain of Climate Resiliant Urban Design (CRUD).
* Submitted a paper on "Contributions to a computational theory of policy advice and avoidability" [^policyadvice] which is clearly extending the state-of-the-art.
* Re-submitted paper: "Sequential decision problems, dependent types and generic solutions" [^SeqDecProb]

[^policyadvice]: Paper submitted 2016-01-06 to the Journal of Functional Programming, Special Issue on Dependently typed Programming. [Full text pre-print available](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~patrikj/papers/CompTheoryPolicyAdviceAvoidability_JFP_2016_preprint.pdf). Uses dependent types to model constraints, while GRACeFUL uses relations

## Events and dissemination

* 2015-02: GRACeFUL kick-off
    * Chalmers was represented by Cezar Ionescu
* 2015-07: [D4.1: Formal description of concept map elements needed for CRUD case study (m6)](../deliverables/d4.1/)
    * The work towards the first WP4 deliverable helped clarifying the underlying theoretical basis and the terminology.
    * It contains
        * a short introduction to Functional Programming and DSLs,
        * an explanation of GRACeFUL as computer aided policy analysis,
        * and a formalisation of the core concepts in Haskell.
* 2015-08: Hand-over from Cezar Ionescu to Irene Lobo Valbuena

## Events and dissemination, part 2

* 2015-08: [ACCFun: Algorithmic Calculi for Constraint Functional Programming](ACCFun.md)
    * A 5-day "by invitation only"-workshop in the GRACeFUL project.
    * 4 participants from GRACeFUL: Patrik, Cezar, Irene, Tom Schrijvers
    * 28 participants in total
    * "The [GRACeFUL project](https://www.graceful-project.eu/) develops connections between functional and constraint programming, requiring a unified expression of programs, constraints, traditional numerical mathematical models and qualitative models. The members of the IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi have developed a large body of expertise in the design of notations for calculating programs from specifications, covering all programming paradigms. Such a notation could provide the glue between functional and constraint programming, required in GRACeFUL. On the other hand, the various programs developed in GRACeFUL can provide a test-bed for the notation and suggest extensions or improvements to it. The aim of this workshop is to create a close connection between GRACeFUL and IFIP2.1. The workshop is co-located with the [73rd IFIP WG 2.1 meeting organised in GÃ¶teborg](http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/IFIP21/Goteborg)."

## IrLoVa Individual Study Plan:

* Apply Functional Programming and Software Technology to hybrid modelling
* Develop Domain Specific Languages for system dynamics modelling
* Example: modelling a water management system taking into account environmental factors influencing it, with the goal of decreasing risk and damage due to floods.

* Hybrid modelling = must handle both discrete and continuous behaviour
* Policy = a protocol or scheme of actions to take

Aim:

* combine and extend functional and logic programming
* formalise GSS-relevant application domains using embedded DSLs
* provide support for policy making in the frame of global systems by
    * refining and translating the system and goal descriptions,
        * along with actions which could embody policies,
    * to adequate models for a constraint solver framework
        * to search for and characterise feasible policies to take.

## Next actions (in year 2)

* T4.2: Create a prototype DSL and iteratively refine it (in collab.\ with WP2)
* T4.3: Provide a simple semantics for the elements of the DSL
* T4.4: Connect the DSL layer to the CFP layer (WP 5)
* T4.5: Develop simple examples and properties (towards the testing and verification framework)

Also ongoing (and overlapping):

* Finish the code + draft paper of the functional-feec project (a DSL for the Finite Element Exterior Calculus)
* Documenting the course "Domain Specific Languages of Mathematics" (DSLsofMath) as a book
* Connect to the Centre of excellence in Global Systems Science (CoeGSS)
