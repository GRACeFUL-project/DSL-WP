Dissecting Def. 3.4 and its dependencies: see [whiteboard 1](2016-09-05 14.12.33.jpg)

A few conclusions:

* When you say that a "random variable X" is "a function from Omega ->
  B" this function is often just a trivial projection from the full
  state space |X| to a subset of interest |B|. Hidden in Omega is a
  probability assignment function delta : Pow Omega -> [0,1].

Example and further work (TODOs):
